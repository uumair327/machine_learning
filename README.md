used sklearn for linear regression

pandas for data set

numpy for handling large dataset

## Later trained model from Scratch Without any Library (Minimum use)

2. Linear Regression From Scratch
Project Description: Implement linear regression from scratch without using any library.
Features: Includes gradient descent optimization with a specified learning rate (alpha).
Dataset: Bank Churners dataset.
Languages Used: Python, pandas, matplotlib, numpy.
